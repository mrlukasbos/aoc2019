Advent of Code 2019 - Teaching myself Haskell

This repo holds code I've written for Advent Of Code 2019 to learn Haskell.
Unfortunately I had to stop at day 15 because I really need to spend time on my studies. Maybe I will finish it later. 
Anyway, I do think my goal to learn Haskell has been achieved very well and this language has quickly become one of my favorite languages as it is so elegant.
